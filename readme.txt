Easily add custom content to your Genesis powered website.

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com). We have no affiliation with the company. We just love building useful tools for Genesis users.

Blox Lite provides you with the easiest way to add custom content to your Genesis powered website. Lets assume you have picked out a theme for your website, but wish you could add a banner image to each post. Or perhaps you want to add a call-to-action just before the site footer but there is no designated widget area for that location. Now you could search the web for the needed code and modify your theme’s functions.php file, but there are 3 problems with this approach:

1. It is not easy!
1. Any updates by the theme's developer will overwrite your modifications
1. Your modifications will not be automatically transferred if you ever desire to switch themes

Blox Lite is the solution. Check out the video below for an introduction to this plugin.

= Features =
* Add content locally to posts, pages, and all public custom post types
* Add content globally to virtually any page(s) on your website including 404 pages, search pages, and archive pages
* Add as many content blocks to a page as you want
* Position content anywhere there is a Genesis Hook
* Display a custom image or featured image
* Display HMTL content
* Add scripts, CSS, iframes, and even PHP
* Plugin is fully translatable (.pot file included)
* **New**: Now includes a few handy utility [shortcodes](https://www.bloxwp.com/documentation/shortcodes/?utm_source=blox-lite&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme-links&utm_campaign=Blox_Plugin_Links)

= Content Options =
* Raw Content
* Static Image

You might be wondering why there are only two content options… Well this is the lite version of [Blox](https://www.bloxwp.com/?utm_source=blox-lite&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme-links&utm_campaign=Blox_Plugin_Links), which is the premium version of this plugin. Not all of the content options that are available in Blox are included in Blox Lite. But don't worry, arguably the two most important ones are! With Raw Content you can add anything to your website, whether that be raw HTML, CSS, Javascript, iframes, shortcodes, and even PHP. If you are looking to add images, such as a banner image, the Static Image option is the way to go. Add a photo directly from your media library, choose the size, add a caption, and more. The Static Image option even supports background images. This is great for setting up responsive headers or adding a parallax effect.

= What Blox Lite Doesn’t Do =

As a general rule, Blox Lite allows you to **add** content. It does not remove existing content. For example, say you hate the footer on your theme and you want to create a custom one using this plugin. Blox Lite will easily enable you to add the new footer, but the old one will be there as well. To remove content, you will need to add the necessary PHP code to your theme’s functions.php file. 

Blox Lite does not include any styling aside from a small amount of default CSS for images, but this can be turned off in the Settings. It is your site and we do not want to impose styling choices on you. Blox Lite will inherit most of your theme’s styling, but you will likely need to add some CSS to get things looking exactly how you want them. This customizability is an intended feature of Blox Lite and makes it all that more powerful. Simple questions about styling can be asked in the plugin’s support forum. If you would like in depth assistance, please look into purchasing the full version of [Blox](https://www.bloxwp.com/?utm_source=blox-lite&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme-links&utm_campaign=Blox_Plugin_Links), which will be available soon. A paid Blox license comes with extensive plugin support.
