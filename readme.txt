Easily customize themes built on the Genesis Framework.

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product of [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com), which has no affiliation with Blox Lite.

Blox Lite allows you to easily customize your Genesis powered website through the use of content blocks. It is not a tool for changing the colors of your theme. While it can wrangle styles, think more along the lines of banner images, dynamic content areas and custom footers. In other words, **structural** customization.

Blox Lite is best demonstrated visually. Check out the video below for an introduction to this plugin.

[Learn more about Blox](https://www.bloxwp.com/?utm_source=blox-lite&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme-links&utm_campaign=Blox_Plugin_Links).

= Content Options =

Blox Lite includes two content options, Raw Content and Static Image. With Raw Content you can add anything to your website, whether that be raw HTML, CSS, Javascript, iframes, shortcodes, and even PHP. If you are looking to add images, such as a banner image, the Static Image option is the way to go. Add a photo directly from your media library, choose the size, add a caption, and more. The Static Image option even supports background images. This is great for setting up responsive headers or adding a parallax effect.

= Removing Content =

As a general rule, Blox Lite allows you to **add** content. It does not remove existing content. For example, Blox Lite will easily allow you to add a custom footer to your site, but the old one will be there as well. To remove content, you will need to add the necessary PHP code to your theme's functions.php file. You can also upgrade to Blox and make use of the [Sandbox Addon](https://www.bloxwp.com/addons/sandbox/?utm_source=blox-lite&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme-links&utm_campaign=Blox_Plugin_Links).

= Style Your Way =

Blox Lite does not include any styling aside from a small amount of default CSS for images, which can be turned off in the Settings. It is your site and we do not want to impose styling choices on you. Blox Lite will inherit most of your theme's styling, but you will likely need to add some additional CSS. This customizability is an intended feature of Blox Lite and makes it all that more powerful. Simple questions about styling can be asked in the plugin’s support forum. If you would like in depth assistance, please look into purchasing the full version of [Blox](https://www.bloxwp.com/?utm_source=blox-lite&utm_medium=plugin&utm_content=readme-links&utm_campaign=Blox_Plugin_Links). A paid Blox license comes with extensive support.
